# Weight Converter

This simple Python program allows users to convert their weight between kilograms and pounds. The user is prompted to input their weight and choose the unit of measurement they want to convert from (either kilograms or pounds).

## Features

- **User Input:** The program takes the user's weight as input and asks for the unit (kilograms or pounds).
- **Conversion:** It converts the weight from kilograms to pounds or pounds to kilograms, depending on the input.
- **Output:** The program outputs the converted weight with one decimal point precision.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter their weight.
2. The program then asks the user whether the weight is in **Kilograms** or **Pounds**.
3. Based on the user's input, the weight is converted accordingly:
   - From **Kilograms (K)** to **Pounds (Lbs)**.
   - From **Pounds (L)** to **Kilograms (Kgs)**.
4. The converted weight is displayed in the appropriate unit with one decimal point precision.

## Example
```
Enter your weight: 70 Kilograms or Pounds? (K or L) K Your weight is: 154.4 Lbs.
```
